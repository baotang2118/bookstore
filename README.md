This project will use docker to deploy. I estimate that it need 3 container:
- python backend: django, djangorestframework
- nodejs: reactjs, boostrap
- postgre DB 

This project will have some API to:
- get the list of books that we have in DB
- get reviews for each book
- save reviews from visitors
- get prices, book's titles, orders, number of books in warehouse
